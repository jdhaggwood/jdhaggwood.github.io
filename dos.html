  <p class="Ralewayfont">Raleway is an elegant sans-serif typeface family. Initially designed by Matt McInerney as a single thin weight,
    it was expanded into a 9 weight family by Pablo Impallari and Rodrigo Fuenzalida in 2012 and iKerned by Igino Marini.
    It also has a sister family, Raleway Dots. t is a display face and the download features both old style and lining numerals, standard and
    discretionary ligatures, a pretty complete set of diacritics, as well as a stylistic alternate inspired by more geometric sans-serif typefaces than
    its neo-grotesque inspired default character set. It also has a sister family, Raleway Dots.</p>
